**Volunteer Facilitator Training – Day 2**

Day 2 of the Kids Hurt Too Hawaiʻi Volunteer Facilitator Training focuses on hands-on skill building and practical application. Building on the foundational theories and models introduced in Day 1, this session gives volunteers the opportunity to practice facilitating in real-world, youth-centered settings.

Participants will engage in interactive activities, role-playing scenarios, and guided exercises designed to strengthen active listening, emotional regulation, group facilitation, and trauma-informed responses. Emphasis is placed on creating safe, supportive spaces for youth, responding to challenging moments with care, and maintaining healthy boundaries while offering meaningful connection.

Day 2 is designed to build confidence through practice, reflection, and feedback—ensuring volunteers feel prepared, supported, and grounded as they step into their role serving children and youth impacted by grief and trauma.
