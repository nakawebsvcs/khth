**Volunteer Facilitator Training – Day 1**

Day 1 of Kids Hurt Too Hawaiʻi’s Volunteer Facilitator Training provides a foundational introduction to working with children and youth impacted by grief and trauma. This session focuses on key theories and evidence-informed models that guide our approach to supporting young people through loss, adversity, and complex emotional experiences.

Participants will explore how grief and trauma uniquely affect children and adolescents, including how these experiences can show up emotionally, behaviorally, and developmentally. The training emphasizes trauma-informed and youth-centered frameworks, helping volunteers better understand the needs of young people and respond with empathy, care, and appropriate boundaries.

This first day lays the groundwork for effective facilitation by building shared language, understanding, and confidence—preparing volunteers to support youth in ways that are compassionate, respectful, and aligned with Kids Hurt Too Hawaiʻi’s mission.
