## A Season of Support: Reflecting on Hawaiʻi’s First Queer Youth Warm Line

This past Christmas season, Kids Hurt Too Hawaiʻi launched a historic pilot: **the state’s first Warm Line dedicated specifically to queer youth**. While the service was offered seasonally, its purpose—and impact—were deeply felt.

The holidays can be especially difficult for queer youth, who statistically face higher rates of mental health challenges, family rejection, and isolation. During a time when feelings of loneliness and stress often intensify, the Queer Youth Warm Line provided a safe, affirming space for young people to talk, be heard, and feel less alone.

Unlike crisis hotlines, the Warm Line offered connection without pressure—meeting youth in the in-between moments, when support is still deeply needed. Trained listeners provided care grounded in understanding, compassion, and respect for each young person’s lived experience.

Though the pilot has ended, it reinforced an important truth: **affirming, accessible support saves lives—and it is needed most during critical seasons like the holidays**.
