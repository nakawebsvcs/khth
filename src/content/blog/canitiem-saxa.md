## **Understanding Grief Through a Hawaiian Lens**

Have you ever felt the weight of loss that seems to seep into every corner of your life? In Hawaiʻi, grief isn’t just about personal sorrow—it is woven into the land we walk on, the family we lean on, and the ancestors whose stories we carry.

For many in the islands, identity is deeply connected to ʻohana (family), ʻāina (land), and moʻokūʻauhau (ancestry). When someone passes, or a loss occurs, it ripples through these connections. Research shows that Native Hawaiians who engage with their culture and sense of place experience lower stress and greater emotional resilience. In other words, the more you are connected—to your roots, your community, and your environment—the more your grief can be held gently, instead of breaking you.

Imagine walking along the shoreline at sunrise, feeling the ocean breeze brush against your face. That connection to the land, to the rhythms of nature, can be a balm for the spirit. In Hawaiʻi, grieving is rarely a solitary act—it’s a relational one, where the land, the family, and the community hold the space for pain, memory, and healing.
