In Hawaiʻi, grief is meant to be expressed openly. One traditional practice, *ʻeha ʻeha*, encourages the heartfelt expression of sorrow through tears, lament, or storytelling. This practice reminds us that feeling pain deeply is a natural and necessary part of healing.

Another Hawaiian concept, *unihipili*, honors the ongoing connection with those who have passed. Loved ones are never truly gone—they remain in spirit, sometimes kept close through personal items, rituals, or even dreams. Many families share stories of sensing their ancestors’ presence, showing that grief is not only about loss but also about maintaining meaningful relationships.

Today, Hawaiians often blend these traditional practices with other spiritual or religious ceremonies. Chanting, hula, music, and storytelling may accompany a memorial or funeral. While these traditions are deeply Hawaiian, the core message resonates with anyone: grieving is not about hiding sadness—it’s about expressing it, remembering those we love, and finding support within our community.
