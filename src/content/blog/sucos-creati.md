Grief isn’t limited to adults. In Hawaiʻi, thousands of children—known as *keiki*—have experienced the death of a parent or caregiver. Imagine being a child trying to understand a world that suddenly feels uncertain and incomplete. Research shows that nearly 3% of children in Hawaiʻi face this type of loss.

Children experience grief differently from adults. Some may act out, withdraw, or struggle in school, while others carry quiet sadness. But grief can be supported. Age-appropriate activities like storytelling, art, or memory rituals allow children to process feelings safely. Stability, routine, and safe spaces are vital.

Even for those outside Hawaiʻi, these practices can offer insight. Community, cultural connection, and intergenerational support matter in healing. By creating spaces where children can express grief, honor memories, and feel supported, we teach them that it’s possible to carry loss while still experiencing joy and hope.
