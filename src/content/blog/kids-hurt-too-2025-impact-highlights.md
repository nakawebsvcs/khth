In 2025, Kids Hurt Too (KHT) delivered meaningful, community-centered support to Hawaiʻi’s children, youth, and families through culturally grounded, trauma-informed care.

Over the year, KHT provided more than 10,000 hours of therapeutic support group services and over 8,000 hours of direct mentoring, reaching more than 5,500 individuals statewide. These services created safe, consistent spaces for healing, growth, and connection.

Working in close collaboration with fellow nonprofit organizations that call the Kukui Center home, Kids Hurt Too strengthened coordinated, wraparound support for families across programs and services.

KHT also hosted three community resource events, delivered crisis response support to over 100 individuals, and brought holiday joy to families by providing Christmas gifts to more than 600 children.

A major milestone in 2025 was the launch of Hawaiʻi’s first and only 24/7 crisis and warm referral line for queer youth and their families, expanding access to affirming support. Kids Hurt Too also expanded services beyond Honolulu and Maui into Waiʻanae, the Nānākuli coastline, and Hā‘ula.

Together with Kukui Center partners, Kids Hurt Too continues to ensure Hawaiʻi’s keiki and families are supported, connected, and never alone.
