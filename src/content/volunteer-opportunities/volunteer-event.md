Aloha ʻIa ʻo Waiʻanae

March 10 | Waiʻanae Elementary School

Kids Hurt Too Hawaiʻi invites volunteers to be part of Aloha ʻIa ʻo Waiʻanae, a community-centered event supporting the students and families of Waiʻanae Elementary School.

Taking place on March 10, this special day is rooted in connection, care, and aloha. Volunteers will help create a welcoming and supportive environment for keiki and ʻohana through hands-on support, engagement, and presence. Opportunities may include assisting with activities, supporting youth-centered spaces, helping with setup and breakdown, and offering general event support.

This volunteer opportunity is ideal for individuals who value community, compassion, and showing up for youth in meaningful ways. No matter the role, every volunteer plays a part in reinforcing safety, belonging, and care for the Waiʻanae community.

For more information or to sign up, please contact info@kidshurttoo.org.
