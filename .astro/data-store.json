This should go without saying, but it doesn't always. Grief may make us more self-focused for a time. And, of course, selfish people grieve. But the act itself is human, normal, and necessary. In a society that values stoicism and, on average, offers less than a week of bereavement leave—where prevailing yet inaccurate grief theories seem to prescribe \"completion\" after five stages—and where, for much of the 20th century, remaining connected to the deceased was seen as pathological, it's not surprising some might feel selfish for focusing on their grief. This is why we often hear people say things like: I'm wallowing in self-pity. I've been talking about or focusing too much on myself. I've been grieving too long. I should put my needs aside for now. I'm taking too much from others. Other people have it worse. Our needs are different when we're grieving. When we’re not grieving or facing another crisis, we often strive to balance our own needs with those of others, or even to put others first. So, for many people, feeling consumed by their grief—and allowing it to spread its tentacles and occupy space—can tip the scales in a way that feels self-absorbed or selfish. But it's beyond logical that grief would cause us to turn inward for a while. We turn inward to tend to the hurricane of thoughts and emotions thrashing within us. We turn inward because that is where we find the people we love who have died—when we close our eyes, when we dream, when we remember. And none of this is selfish. In fact, some might even say it teaches us something about how to love. Grief is not selfish \"the most unselfish, the freest, the most faithful love\" Death, loss, and grief are an innate part of the human experience. They have been with us since the very beginning, so it’s no surprise that countless artists, poets, and philosophers have reflected on them throughout history. Sometimes I find past understandings of grief at odds with how I think about it today. But other times, someone from 200 years ago says something that resonates so deeply that I’m reminded how universal experiences like love and grief can connect us, even across centuries. To that point, for anyone struggling with the feeling that their grief is selfish, I recommend the words of Søren Kierkegaard from \"Works of Love,\" written in 1847 in Denmark. Kierkegaard on Grief Kierkegaard, often regarded today as the \"father of existentialism,\" wrote that loving the dead is one of the most unselfish, free, and faithful acts of love possible, because we give this love despite knowing that the deceased can offer us nothing in return. They cannot repay us with affection or words of love; they are gone. We are met only with painful silence, and yet we still persist in loving. Because Kierkegaard was heavily influenced by his faith, he was concerned not only with how we show love to our family and friends, but also to our neighbors—to our fellow human beings. He believed that the love we show in loss should inspire us to love others in a similarly selfless way. Even though our neighbors may not be willing or able to reciprocate our love and kindness, we should still offer it. He writes: “The work of love in recollecting one who is dead is thus a work of the most unselfish, the freest, the most faithful love. Therefore go out and practice it; recollect the one who is dead and just in this way learn to love the living unselfishly, freely, faithfully.” Does grief sometimes lead to selfish actions or behaviors? Sure, and we'd all do well to stay mindful of that. But simply holding on to someone, taking the time to connect through love and pain, acknowledging the anguish of their absence, and reflecting on how they live on in this world—that is not selfish. And doing all this in a world that is not always supportive of ongoing grief? Well, I think I agree with Kierkegaard on this one.","src/content/blog/acuti-modo.md",[26],"/src/assets/images/blog/untitled-design-18-2048x1286.jpg","d48851239c34b8e1",{"html":29,"metadata":30},"\u003Cp>Grief is not selfish.

Instead of urging us to “move on,” it reminds us that it’s normal, even healthy, to maintain a connection with our loved ones after they’ve died.

As in...\n\n“A-ha! That makes so much sense.”\n\n“A-ha! I knew I wasn’t crazy.”\n\n“A-ha! That’s exactly how I feel.”\n\nContinuing bonds is an idea that brings clarity, normalcy, and understanding to many who hear it. It's one of those concepts that makes so much sense that it feels like you already knew it, except you didn’t know that you knew it until someone put it into words.\n\n\\[Note: This may not be true for everyone. Many people do not find comfort in continuing a bond with their deceased loved ones for a variety of reasons, and that’s okay.]\n\nOkay, I'm going to back up a little because I know some of you are thinking \"What is this grief jargon that you speak of?\" If you've never heard of 'Continuing Bonds' (CB), you're not alone. This concept emerged from grief literature which, let's be honest, most people haven't read.\n\nPlease allow me to introduce CB by sharing an excerpt from our grief journaling e-course: \n\nIn 1996, Klass, Silverman, and Nickman shed light on an important bereavement concept in the book Continuing Bonds: New Understandings of Grief. Their work questioned linear models of grief that are supposed to lead to things like acceptance, detachment, and new life and which view behaviors that promote a continued bond with deceased loved ones as pathological.\n\nKlass and colleagues disagreed with this notion and suggested a paradigm in which it is normal for the bereaved to continue their bond with the deceased. In their work, they observed many cases in which remaining connected to the deceased provided comfort and support in coping with loss and adjustment.\n\nSound familiar? If not, that's okay. We've written about CB here, here, here, and here, but with over 500 articles, that a very small fraction of what you will find here on WYG. The same goes for other grief literature. So today I want to make a case for why, if you care about one grief concept and one grief concept only, it should be continuing bonds. Not because we believe this idea is prescriptive, but because it brings such a sense of okay-ness and empowerment to people who want to continue their bond with their loved one but who’ve felt they can’t or shouldn’t. Generally speaking, I have four main reasons.\n\n1. Continuing bonds acknowledges that grief is ongoing.\n\nI’ve run out of metaphors for saying that grief never ends, so I’ll just tell it straight. Grief never ends. Grief isn’t something you go through, it’s something that becomes a part of you. It’s forever.\n\nThe good news is, you may find that over time, as make room for grief's necessary existence, it becomes a more peaceful and positive presence. One where warm memories and a connection with your loved one can grow.\n\n2. Continuing bonds says that it's normal to stay connected with your loved one.\n\nNot only does CB validate that grief is ongoing, it supports the idea that we, as bereaved people, remain connected with our loved ones, often for our entire lives. We don't detach from them or leave them behind, we carry them with us throughout our lives. Interestingly, Klass and colleagues also found that these relationships are not static. Instead, they evolve and mature right along with us, so that you see and relate to your deceased loved ones through a different lens at 30, 40, 50 and so on.\n\nThis is validation that isn’t always found in our broader society, among our friends and family, or even in our own beliefs and attitudes about grief and coping. So spread the word because if everyone understood this, I think grieving people might feel a little better understood (and a little less crazy).\n\nWe don't leave deceased loved ones behind. Rather, we carry them with us throughout our lives.\n\n3. Continuing bonds may describe many of your grief-related behaviors.\n\nHolding onto items, daily habits, private rituals, conversations with your loved one, visiting places where you feel close to them, thinking about them... These are all ways people continue bonds with deceased loved ones. These are the behaviors often come naturally to grieving people, but which may have been seen as pathological by past grief models (and society as a whole).\n\n4. Continuing bonds says that not only are these behaviors normal, but they may help you cope with grief.\n\nSociety is making strides, but many people still believe that staying attached to a deceased loved one is pathological. As a result, many people worry about their CB behaviors and wonder - Is this okay? Does this mean I'm not coping well with grief? Should I be worried? Am I stuck?\n\nFear not, though, Klass et al (1996) found in their research that remaining connected seemed to facilitate the bereaved’s ability to cope with loss and accompanying changes in their lives. So, do more of them!\n\nYes, this is normal.\n\nOf course, it is important to note that there are instances where continuing a bond with a deceased loved one is not healing. Just as relationships with the living can be complicated, so can relationships with the dead and if the relationship was troubling prior to the death, it may remain so afterward.\n\nOkay, so there you have it. I've made my case; albeit there is so much more to be said on this topic. If you want to learn more about Continuing Bonds, we have a few learning opportunities on the horizon.
